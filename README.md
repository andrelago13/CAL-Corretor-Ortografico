# CAL-Corretor-Ortografico

Project developed for the "Conception and Analysis of Algorithms" (CAL) course of the Integrated Master's in Informatics and Computer Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto.

The project consists in a text corrector that, given a certain text and a dictionary, finds incorrect words in the text suggesting changes according to the wrong word's proximity to those on the dictionary.
